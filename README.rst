Antidotes is a dependency injection micro-framework for Python 3.6+. It is built on the
idea of ensuring best **maintainability** of your code while being as **easy to use** as possible.
It also provides the **fastest** injection with :code:`@inject` allowing you to use it virtually anywhere
and **fast full isolation of your tests**.

Antidote provides the following features:

- Ease of use
    - Injection anywhere you need through a decorator :code:`@inject`, be it static methods, functions, etc..
      By default, it will only rely on annotated type hints, but it supports a lot more!
    - No :code:`**kwargs` arguments hiding actual arguments and fully mypy typed, helping you and your IDE.
    - `Documented <https://antidote.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_, everything has tested examples.
    - No need for any custom setup, just use your injected function as usual. You just don't have to specify
      injected arguments anymore. Allowing you to gradually migrate an existing project.
    - Documented, with a lot of tested examples.
- Flexibility
    - Most common dependencies out of the box: services, configuration, factories, interface/implementation.
    - All of those are implemented on top of the core implementation. If Antidote doesn't provide what you need, there's
      a good chance you can implement it yourself.
    - Scope support
    - Async injection
- Maintainability
    - All dependencies can be tracked back to their declaration/implementation easily.
    - Mypy compatibility and usage of type hints as much as possible.
    - Overriding dependencies will raise an error outside of tests.
    - Dependencies can be frozen, which blocks any new declarations.
    - No double injection.
    - Everything is as explicit as possible, :code:`@inject` does not inject anything implicitly.
    - Type checks when a type is explicitly defined with :code:`world.get`, :code:`world.lazy` and constants.
    - Thread-safe, cycle detection.
    - Immutable whenever possible. Overrides are not possible outside of tests.
- Testability
    - :code:`@inject` lets you override any injections by passing explicitly the arguments.
    - Fully isolate each test with :code:`world.test.clone`. They will work on the separate objects.
    - Override any dependency locally in a test.
    - When encountering issues you can retrieve the full dependency tree, nicely formatted, with :code:`world.debug`.
- Performance\*
    - Fastest :code:`@inject` with heavily tuned Cython.
    - As much as possible is done at import time.
    - Testing utilities are tuned to ensure that even with full isolation it stays fast.
    - Benchmarks:
      `comparison <https://github.com/Finistere/antidote/blob/master/comparison.ipynb>`_,
      `injection <https://github.com/Finistere/antidote/blob/master/benchmark.ipynb>`_,

Hands-on quick start
====================

Showcase of the most important features of Antidote with short and concise examples.
Checkout the `Getting started`_ for a full beginner friendly tutorial.

Injection
---------

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import Service, inject, Provide

    class Database(Service):
        pass

    @inject
    def f(db: Provide[Database]):
        pass

    f()  # works !

Simple, right ? And you can still use it like a normal function, typically when testing it:

.. code-block:: python

    f(Database())

:code:`@inject` supports a lot of different ways to express which dependency should be
used, the most important ones are:

- annotated type hints:
    .. code-block:: python

        @inject
        def f(db: Provide[Database]):
            pass

- list:
    .. code-block:: python

        @inject([Database])
        def f(db):
            pass

- dictionary:
    .. code-block:: python

        @inject({'db': Database})
        def f(db):
            pass

- auto_provide
    .. code-block:: python

        # All class type hints are treated as dependencies
        @inject(auto_provide=True)
        def f(db: Database):
            pass

You can also retrieve the dependency by hand with :code:`world.get`:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import world

    # Retrieve dependencies by hand, in tests typically
    world.get(Database)
    world.get[Database](Database)  # with type hint
    world.get[Database]()  # omit dependency if it's the type hint itself


Service
-------

Services are classes for which Antidote provides an instance. It can be a singleton or not.
Scopes are also supported. Every method is injected by default, relying on annotated type
hints. It can also be parametrized or configured differently.

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import Service, Provide, inject

    class QueryBuilder(Service):
        __antidote__ = Service.Conf(singleton=False)  # new instance each time

        # methods injected by default
        def __init__(self, db: Provide[Database]):
            self._db = db

    @inject({'builder': QueryBuilder})
    def load_data(builder):
        pass

    load_data()  # yeah !


Constants
---------

Constants are, by definition, constants that Antidote provides lazily. It's primary use
case is configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import inject, Constants, const

    class Config(Constants):
        DB_HOST = const('localhost')

    @inject([Config.DB_HOST])
    def ping_db(db_host: str):
        pass

    ping_db()  # nice !

Now this looks a bit overkill, but it allows you to refactor it easily or load complex
configuration lazily. Here is a similar example, but loading the configuration from
the environment:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Annotated
    # from typing_extensions import Annotated # Python < 3.9
    from antidote import inject, Constants, const, Get

    class Config(Constants):
        DB_HOST = const[str]()  # used as a type annotation
        DB_PORT = const[int]()  # and also to cast the value retrieved from `provide_const`
        DB_USER = const[str](default='postgres')  # defaults are supported

        def provide_const(self, name: str, arg: object):
            return os.environ[name]

    import os
    os.environ['DB_HOST'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['DB_PORT'] = '5432'

    @inject()
    def check_connection(db_host: Annotated[str, Get(Config.DB_HOST)],
                         db_port: Annotated[int, Get(Config.DB_PORT)]):
        pass

    check_connection()  # perfect !

Note that we could have replaced the previous :code:`Config` without any changes in the
clients.


Factory
-------

Factories are used by Antidote to generate a dependency. It can either be a class or a function.
The resulting dependency can be a singleton or not. Scopes are also supported. If a class is used
it'll be wired (injection of methods) in the same way as :code:`Service`:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import factory, inject, Provide

    class User:
        pass

    @factory(singleton=False)  # annotated type hints can be used or you can @inject manually
    def current_user(db: Provide[Database]) -> User:  # return type annotation is used
        return User()

    # Note that here you *know* exactly where it's coming from.
    @inject({'user': User @ current_user})
    def is_admin(user: User):
        pass

Easy to understand where the dependency is actually coming from ! Like :code:`Service`,
you can also retrieve it by hand:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import world

    world.get(User @ current_user)
    world.get[User](User @ current_user)  # with type hint
    world.get[User] @ current_user  # same, but shorter

Now with a request scope and a factory class:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Annotated
    # from typing_extensions import Annotated # Python < 3.9
    from antidote import Factory, inject, Provide, world, From

    REQUEST_SCOPE = world.scopes.new(name='request')

    class CurrentUser(Factory):
        __antidote__ = Factory.Conf(scope=REQUEST_SCOPE)

        # injecting it in __call__() would have also worked
        def __init__(self, db: Provide[Database]):
            self._db = db

        def __call__(self) -> User:
            return User()

    @inject
    def is_admin(user: Annotated[User, From(CurrentUser)]):
        pass

    is_admin()

    # Reset all dependencies in the specified scope.
    world.scopes.reset(REQUEST_SCOPE)

Here also, knowing where and how a scope is used is straightforward with an IDE.


Interface/Implementation
------------------------

The distinction between an interface and its implementation lets you choose between multiple
implementations, which one to use. This choice can be permanent or not. For the latter, Antidote
will retrieve the current implementation each time:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import Service, implementation, inject, factory

    class Cache:
        pass

    class MemoryCache(Cache, Service):
        pass

    class Redis:
        """ class from an external library """

    @factory
    def redis_cache() -> Redis:
        return Redis()

    @implementation(Cache)
    def cache_impl():
        import os

        if os.environ.get('USE_REDIS_CACHE'):
            return Redis @ redis_cache

        # Returning the dependency that must be retrieved
        return MemoryCache

The cache can then be retrieved with the same syntax as a factory:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Annotated
    # from typing_extensions import Annotated # Python < 3.9
    from antidote import world, inject, From

    @inject
    def heavy_compute(cache: Annotated[Cache, From(cache_impl)]):
        pass


    world.get[Cache] @ cache_impl

Like factories, it's easy to know where the dependency is coming from !


Testing and Debugging
---------------------

:code:`inject` always allows you to pass your own argument to override the injection:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import Service, inject, Provide

    class Database(Service):
        pass

    @inject
    def f(db: Provide[Database]):
        pass

    f()
    f(Database())  # test with specific arguments in unit tests

You can also fully isolate your tests from each other and override any dependency within
that context:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import world

    # Clone current world to isolate it from the rest
    with world.test.clone():
        x = object()
        # Override the Database
        world.test.override.singleton(Database, x)
        f()  # will have `x` injected for the Databas

        @world.test.override.factory(Database)
        def override_database():
            class DatabaseMock:
                pass

            return DatabaseMock()

        f()  # will have `DatabaseMock()` injected for the Database

If you ever need to debug your dependency injections, Antidote also provides a tool to
have a quick summary of what is actually going on:

.. code-block:: python

    def function_with_complex_dependencies():
        pass

    world.debug(function_with_complex_dependencies)
    # would output something like this:
    """
    main
    └── Permanent implementation: MovieDB @ current_movie_db
        └──<∅> IMDBMovieDB
            └── ImdbAPI @ imdb_factory
                └── imdb_factory
                    ├── Const: Config.IMDB_API_KEY
                    │   └── Config
                    ├── Const: Config.IMDB_PORT
                    │   └── Config
                    └── Const: Config.IMDB_HOST
                        └── Config

    Singletons have no scope markers.
    <∅> = no scope (new instance each time)
    <name> = custom scope
    """

Compiled
========

The compiled implementation is roughly 10x faster than the Python one and strictly follows the
same API than the pure Python implementation. Pre-compiled wheels are available only for Linux currently.
You can check whether you're using the compiled version or not with:

.. code-block:: python

    from antidote import is_compiled
    
    f"Is Antidote compiled ? {is_compiled()}"

You can force the compilation of antidote yourself when installing:

.. code-block:: bash

    ANTIDOTE_COMPILED=true pip install antidote
    
On the contrary, you can force the pure Python version with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-binary antidote

.. note::

    The compiled version is not tested against PyPy. The compiled version relies currently on Cython,
    but it is not part of the public API. Relying on it in your own Cython code is at your risk.


How to Contribute
=================

1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a
   feature or a bug.
2. Fork the repo on GitHub. Run the tests to confirm they all pass on your
   machine. If you cannot find why it fails, open an issue.
3. Start making your changes to the master branch.
4. Writes tests which shows that your code is working as intended. (This also
   means 100% coverage.)
5. Send a pull request.

*Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!*

If you have any issue during development or just want some feedback, don't hesitate
to open a pull request and ask for help !

Pull requests **will not** be accepted if:

- public classes/functions have not docstrings documenting their behavior with examples.
- tests do not cover all of code changes (100% coverage) in the pure python.

If you face issues with the Cython part of Antidote, I may implement it myself.
