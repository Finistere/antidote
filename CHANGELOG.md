0.7.0  (2020-01-15)
-------------------

### Breaking changes

- `@register` does not wire `__init__()` anymore if a function is provided as a factory.
  This didn't make a lot of sense, `__init__()` is wrapped automatically if and only if 
  it is treated as the "factory" that creates the object.
- Now when using `dependencies` argument with a sequence (matching dependencies with arguments 
  through their position), the first argument will be ignored for methods (`self`) and 
  classmethod (`cls`). So now you can write:
  ```python
  from antidote import inject, register
  
  class Service:
      @inject(dependencies=('dependency',))
      def method(self, arg1):
          ...
  
      @inject(dependencies=('dependency',))
      @classmethod
      def method(cls, arg1):
          ...
  
  @register(dependencies=('dependency',))
  class Service2:
      def __init__(self, arg1):
          ...
  ```
  Hence all other decorators profit from this. No need anymore to explicitly ignore `self`.

### Bug fixes

- Prevent double `LazyMethodCall` wrapping in `LazyConstantsMeta` (Thanks @keelerm84)
- `@inject` cannot be applied on classes. This was never intended as it would not
  return a class. Use `@wire` instead if you relied on this.
- `@inject` returned `ValueError` instead of `TypeError` in with erroneous types.
- `@register` now raises an error when using a method as a factory that is neither a
  classmethod nor a staticmethod. It was never intended to use methods, as it would not
  make sense.

### Changes

- When wrapping multiple methods, `@wire` used to raise an error if a sequence was 
  provided for `dependencies`. This limitation has been removed.


0.6.1  (2019-12-01)
-------------------

- Add support for Python 3.8


0.6.0 (2019-05-06)
------------------
  
### Features

- Add `@implements` to define service implementing an interface. 
- Add `IndirectProvider()` which supports `@implements`.
- Add `DependencyContainer.safe_provide()` which does the same as 
  `DependencyContainer.provide()` except that it raises an error if
  the dependency cannot be found instead of returning None.


### Breaking changes

- `DependencyContainer.provide()` returns a `DependencyInstance` not the 
  instance itself anymore.
- Rename `LazyConfigurationMeta` to `LazyConstantsMeta`.
- `LazyConfigurationMeta` default method is `get()`.
- `ServiceProvider` renamed to `FactoryProvider` and reworked 
  `ServiceProvider.register()` with is split into `register_factory()`,
  `register_class`, `register_providable_factory`.


### Changes

- Moved `is_compiled` to `antidote.utils`.
- Add better type hints.


0.5.1 (2019-04-27)
------------------
  
### Features

- Add `is_compiled()` to check whether the current version is compiled or pure 
  python.


0.5.0 (2019-04-27)
------------------

### Breaking changes

- `@resource` has been removed an replaced by `LazyConfigurationMeta` to handle 
  configuration. 
  
### Features

- Add `LazyMethodCall` and `LazyCall` to support output of functions as dependencies.

### Changes

- Add better type hints for helper decorators.


0.4.0 (2019-02-03)
------------------

A lot of internals have changed, but it can roughly be resumed as the following:

### Breaking changes

- The `DependencyManager` does not exist anymore and has been replaced by 
  multiple helpers which accepts a `container` argument. By default the global
  container of Antidote is used. Thus one can easily replace 
  `from antidote import antidote` to `import antidote` to adapt existing code.
- The global container of Antidote, previously named `container`, has been 
  renamed `world`.
- `Dependency` does not take additional arguments anymore, for custom 
  dependencies `Build`, `Tagged` must be used instead.
- Custom providers must inherit `Provider`.
- `register_parameters()` has been replaced by a more general function, 
  `resource()`. See the documentation to imitate its functionality.
- `factory()` is more strict. Subclasses are not handled anymore, one should
  use `register()` with its `factory` argument instead.

### Features

- Dependencies can be tagged at registration. Those can then be retrieved as
  a dependency. This allows one to extend an app by registering a service in
  special way just by adding a tag.
- Type hints usage can now be finely controlled or disabled with `use_type_hints`.
- Add `resource()` to support custom resources, such as configuration.
- Dependency providers are more strict for more maintainable code.
- Use of Cython for better injection performance.
