    Subclass of :py:class:`.ReadOnlyCatalog` for dependency access.

    A catalog is a collection of dependencies that can be provided. It ensures that singletons
    and bound dependencies are created in a thread-safe manner. But the actual instantiation
    is handled by one of its :py:class:`.Provider`.

    A catalog may have one or more child catalogs which are traversed after the providers. So any
    dependency defined in the catalog's children can be overridden by the catalog's own providers.
    To prevent any race conditions on the catalog locks, a catalog can only have one parent and as
    such be included only once.

    Catalogs are always created by pair, a private and a public (:py:class:`.PublicCatalog`) one.
    Most of the time one would manipulate the public one. The private's only purpose is to allow the
    definition of private dependencies which are not directly accessible from the public catalog.
    This is only needed for library/framework authors who want to expose only a subset of the
    dependencies registered. In this case, it's recommended to freeze the catalog before exposing
    it to ensure proper isolation.

      :py:class:`.Provider` and child catalog. But those will be empty as if no dependency was

    - :py:meth:`~.TestCatalogBuilder.clone`: All of the :py:class:`.Provider`, child catalog and

                can be explicitly defined by passing a dictionary or automatically detected with
                :py:mod:`inspect` and frame manipulation by specifying :code:`'auto'`. Specifying
                :py:obj:`None` will deactivate the use of locals. When :code:`ignore_type_hints` is
                :py:obj:`True`, this features cannot be used. The default behavior depends on the
                :py:data:`.config` value of :py:attr:`~.Config.auto_detect_type_hints_locals`. If

                it will be :py:obj:`.app_catalog` defined by a upstream :py:obj:`.inject`. If never
                never specified, it's py:obj:`.world`. However, dependencies such as
                :py:func:`.injectable` use :py:meth:`.Inject.rewire` to force the use of the catalog
                in which the dependency is registered. If explicitely specified, it cannot be
                changed afterwards and can be either a :py:class:`.Catalog` or
