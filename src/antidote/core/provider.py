    .. warning::
        This is most advanced feature of Antidote and allows you to extend Antidote's
        behavior. So be careful with it, it will impact the whole library. There are
        several rules to respect:

        1. Different _providers MUST provide strictly different dependencies.
        2. You MUST NOT use :py:mod:`~antidote.world`. If you need a dependency, rely on
           the provided :py:class:`~.core.container.Container`.
        3. Methods will automatically freeze except those marked with the decorator
           :py:func:`~.does_not_freeze`. You may only use it on methods which do NOT
           modify the provider or methods only called by ones that are frozen.
           :py:meth:`~.provide` and :py:meth:`~.clone` are the only methods that are not
           affected.
        4. You may cache singletons by yourself, but you need to clean your cache when
           :py:meth:`~.clone` is called with :code:`keep_singletons_cache=False`.
