Tutorial
========

This tutorial is a quick lesson on how to use Antidote features to write better
code. It is a series of steps to show what can be done easily.


1. Overview
-----------

First of all, let's start with a quick example:

.. testcode:: tutorial_overview

    from antidote import inject, register

    @register
    class Service:
        pass

    @inject
    def f(service: Service):
        """ doing stuff here """
        return service


Now you can call the function :code:`f` without having to handle the creation
of the dependency :code:`Service` as it was registered before:

.. doctest:: tutorial_overview

    >>> f()
    <Service object at ...>

But you can still use :code:`f` like any other function:

.. doctest:: tutorial_overview

    >>> f(None)

If you need to retrieve :code:`Service` directly you can use the global
:py:class:`.DependencyContainer`:

.. doctest:: tutorial_overview

    >>> from antidote import world
    >>> world.get(Service)
    <Service object at ...>

By default, it will return same instance every time:

.. doctest:: tutorial_overview

    >>> world.get(Service) is world.get(Service)
    True

Let's take a quick look on how this works. It can be simplified to three
parts ::

                 +-----------+
          +----->| Container +------+
          |      +-----------+      |

     @register,...               @inject

          |                         |
          |                         v
    +-----+------+             +----------+
    | Dependency |             | Function |
    +------------+             +----------+

- a set of helper decorators such as :py:func:`.register` to define
  dependencies.
- a single container holding your dependencies
- :py:func:`.inject` which injects them into your function

In the next steps we will go through how Antidote can be used to inject
different kind of dependencies.


2. Services
-----------

A service is a class which provides some sort of functionality. A common one is
a class serving as an interface to a database:

.. testcode:: tutorial_services

    from antidote import inject, register

    @register
    class Database:
        def __init__(self):
            self.users = [dict(name='Bob')]

    @inject
    def get_user_count(db: Database):
        return len(db.users)

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> get_user_count()
    1

:py:func:`.inject` has automatically determined which dependency should be
injected based on the type hints. Antidote uses annotations as type hints and
nothing else. It is entirely compatible with tools like Mypy.

Dependencies are only injected when they have not been supplied to the
function. So you can write unit tests for the function easily:

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> get_user_count(Database())
    1

This works nicely, but what if we need other statistics ? Let's create a new
service for this:

.. testcode:: tutorial_services

    from antidote import register

    @register
    class DatabaseStatistics:
        def __init__(self, db: Database):
            self._db = db

        def get_user_count(self):
            return len(self._db.users)

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> from antidote import world
    >>> world.get(DatabaseStatistics).get_user_count()
    1

No need to use :py:func:`.inject` on :code:`__init__`, :py:func`.register` will
automatically inject any dependencies required by it. This is called
auto-wiring, and more complex behaviors is possible with the parameter
:code:`auto_wire`. Here :code:`auto_wire` is simply equal to :obj:`True`.

Statistics are great, but getting the first user would also be helpful. Let's
define its class first:

.. testcode:: tutorial_services

    class User:
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name

        def __repr__(self):
            return 'User(name={!r})'.format(self.name)

Unfortunately :py:func:`.register` is not enough here, User does not know to
instantiate itself with the first user. But don't worry, Antidote has what we
need, a factory:

.. testcode:: tutorial_services

    from antidote import factory

    @factory
    def first_user(db: Database) -> User:
        return User(**db.users[0])

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> world.get(User)
    User(name='Bob')

:py:func:`factory` uses the return type hint as the dependency ID.

But what happens if we modify the database now ?

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> world.get(Database).users = [dict(name='Alice'), dict(name='John')]
    >>> get_user_count()
    2
    >>> world.get(DatabaseStatistics).get_user_count()
    2

Perfect ! What about our first user ?

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> world.get(User)
    User(name='Bob')

But... :code:`'Bob'` is not even in our database anymore ! We just missed an
important part of dependency injection, the scope of the dependency. The scope
is the context in which an specific instance is valid as a dependency. The
default scope is singleton, which means that dependencies are only instantiated
once during the application lifetime.

.. testcode:: tutorial_services

    class FirstUser:
        pass

    @factory(singleton=False)
    def first_user(db: Database) -> FirstUser:
        return User(**db.users[0])

.. doctest:: tutorial_services

    >>> world.get(FirstUser)
    User(name='Alice')

Here we created another type as Antidote does not accept any duplicate
dependency IDs.


3. Configuration
----------------

Every applications needs to load its configuration from somewhere, one simple
way to do this is to load a file into a global dictionary :code:`config` and
import it wherever necessary, like this:

.. testcode:: tutorial_conf

    config = dict(domain='example.com', port=3000)

    def absolute_url(path: str, domain: str = None, port: int = None):
        domain = domain or config['domain']
        port = port or config['port']
        return f"https://{domain}:{port}{path}"

Now we can call :code:`absolute_url` without needing to be aware of what it
needs and are still able to test it properly with unit tests without having to
change the global configuration. There are two major downsides here:

- we have now a tight coupling of the application code and the configuration
  as the inner body needs to know how to retrieve the configuration. If you need
  more complex parameters, from multiple sources or lazily loaded for example,
  you'll probably need to either adapt all functions like :code:`absolute_url`
  or create custom code to emulate your existing :code:`config`.
- Retrieving configuration through a string :code:`'domain'` makes refactoring
  more complicated, as your IDE cannot provide any support for refactoring.


Let's give Antidote a shot and see what we can do:

.. testcode:: tutorial_conf

    from antidote import LazyConfigurationMeta, inject

    class Conf(metaclass=LazyConfigurationMeta):
        DOMAIN = 'domain'
        PORT = 'port'

        def __init__(self):
            # Load anything you need and/or use dependencies.
            self._data = dict(domain='example.com', port=3000)

        def __call__(self, key):
            return self._data[key]

    @inject(dependencies=(None, Conf.DOMAIN, Conf.PORT))
    def absolute_url_v2(path: str, domain: str, port: int):
        return f"https://{domain}:{port}{path}"

.. doctest:: tutorial_conf

    >>> absolute_url_v2("/user/1")
    'https://example.com:3000/user/1'
    >>> absolute_url_v2('/dog/2', port=80)
    'https://example.com:80/dog/2'

Pretty easy ! Now you may think, that's a lot of code to access :code:`config`,
but it is much more flexible:

- :code:`Conf` has :code:`__init__()` and :code:`__call__()` injected, so you can
  rely on other dependencies easily.
- Everything is lazy, even the instantiation of :code:`Conf`.

:py:class:`.LazyConfigurationMeta` accepts several parameters to customize its behavior:

.. testcode:: tutorial_conf

    from antidote import LazyConfigurationMeta

    class CustomizedConf(metaclass=LazyConfigurationMeta, lazy_method='get', auto_wire=False):
        DOMAIN = 'domain'
        PORT = 'port'

        def __init__(self):
            self._data = dict(domain='example.com', port=3000)

        def get(self, key):
            return self._data[key]

.. note::

    Only public uppercase class attributes will be converted to dependencies.
    This means that :code:`A` will be changed, but not :code:`_A` neither
    :code:`a`.


4. Lazy function calls
----------------------

Sometimes a dependency can be the output of a function call, which could fetch remote
configuration with a network call. To avoid multiple round trips you would cache the
results, like this:

.. testsetup:: tutorial_lazy

    import sys

    class DummyRequests:
        def get(url):
            return dict()

    sys.modules['requests'] = DummyRequests()

.. testcode:: tutorial_lazy

    import requests
    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache(maxsize=32)
    def fetch_remote_conf(name):
        return requests.get(f"https://example.com/conf/{name}")

    def f(conf = None):
        conf = conf if conf is not None else fetch_remote_conf("conf_1")

This has one downside, it requires :code:`f()` to be aware of how to call
:code:`fetch_remote_conf` and with which arguments. Now with Antidote:

.. testcode:: tutorial_lazy

    from antidote import LazyCall, inject

    def fetch_remote_conf(name):
        return requests.get(f"https://example.com/conf/{name}")

    CONF_1 = LazyCall(fetch_remote_conf)("conf_1")

    @inject(dependencies=(CONF_1,))
    def f(conf):
        pass


5. Tags
-------

Tags are a way to retrieve a list of services, such as plugins, extensions, etc...

.. testcode:: tutorial_tags

    from antidote import register, Tag

    @register(tags=['dummies', Tag('extension', version=1)])
    class Service:
        pass

    @register(tags=['dummies', Tag('extension', version=2)])
    class Service2:
        pass

.. doctest:: tutorial_tags

    >>> from antidote import world, Tagged
    >>> services = world.get(Tagged('extension'))
    >>> list(zip(services.tags(), services.dependencies(), services.instances()))
    [(Tag(name='extension', version=1), <class 'Service'>, <Service object at ...>), (Tag(name='extension', version=2), <class 'Service2'>, <Service2 object at ...>)]


5. Providers
------------

While Antidote provides several ways to handle your dependencies out of the box, it may
not be enough. But don't worry, Antidote got you covered ! It is designed from the ground
up to have an easily extendable core mechanism. Services, resources and tags are all
handled in the same way, through a custom :py:class:`.DependencyProvider` ::

                    +-------------+
      tag=... +-----> TagProvider +----+
                    +-------------+    |
                                       |
                 +------------------+  |    +----------+    +-----------+
    @resource +--> ResourceProvider +-------> Provider +----> Container +---> @inject
                 +------------------+  |    +----------+    +-----------+
                                       |
                  +-----------------+  |
    @register +---> ServiceProvider +--+
                  +-----------------+

The container never handles the instantiation of the dependencies itself, it mostly
handles their scope. Let's suppose you want to inject a random number through Antidote,
without passing through a Service. You could do it the following way:


.. testcode:: tutorial_tags

    import random
    from typing import Any, Optional

    import antidote
    from antidote.core import DependencyProvider, DependencyInstance

    @antidote.provider
    class RandomProvider(DependencyProvider):
        def provide(self, dependency: Any) -> Optional[DependencyInstance]:
            if dependency == 'random':
                return DependencyInstance(random.random(), singleton=False)

.. doctest:: tutorial_tags

    >>> from antidote import world
    >>> world.get('random')
    0...
    >>> world.get('random')
    0...

Provider are in most cases tried sequentially. So if a provider returns nothing,
it is simply ignored and another provider is tried. For the same reason it is not
recommended to have a lot of different :py:class:`.DependencyProvider`\ s as this
implies a performance penalty.
